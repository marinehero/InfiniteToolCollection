# InfiniteToolCollection

This is an initial braindump. I will be organizing as I get time.

Everyone collects or use online utilities, and most folks have a list of a few that they feel are indispensable.  Here's my ongoing list. Each has a distinct purpose, and I probably touch each at least a few times a week/month/year.  For me, "util" means utilitarian and it means don't clutter my tray.  If it saves me time, and seamlessly integrates with my life, it's the bomb. Many/most are free some aren't. Those that aren't free are very likely worth your 30-day trial, and very likely worth your money.

# Dev Tools

This page contains some usefull tools for development in general, cli and online.

* [Awesome CLI Apps](https://github.com/aharris88/awesome-cli-apps) - A curated list of command line apps.

* [Chocolatey](http://www.chocolatey.org/) – It’s a weird name, but it’s apt-get for Windows and once you start using it, you’ll be hooked. I tend to use it by default, even before Googling, to install stuff. Consider a "favoriteutils" batch file for building new machines and you'll be off and running in no time. Even better, use...
* [Boxstarter](http://boxstarter.org/) - Build on top of Chocolatey and NuGet and create complete Windows environments and push them to your machines with Gists from your friends or your own GitHub. Even deploy to remote machines or Hyper-V with 100% unattended installs.
* [TeraCopy](http://codesector.com/teracopy) - While I use the excellent built in copy features of Windows 8.1 the most, when I want to move a LOT of files as FAST as possible, nothing beats TeraCopy, an app that does just that - move stuff fast.
* [NimbleText](http://nimbletext.com/) - Regular Expressions are hard and I'm not very smart. NimbleText lets me do crazy stuff with large amounts of text without it hurting so much.
* [GOW Gnu on Windows](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow) - Sometimes Cygwin is just overkill. Gow is 130 useful *nix command line utilities recompiled as native Win32 binaries.
* [F.lux](http://justgetflux.com/) - I admit, I thought this was stupid when I started using it. It took a few days, but now, given that I have 3 large monitors, I can't live without it. It slowly, imperceptibly, changes the color temperature of your monitor's color as the sky itself changes. It prevents (for me) headaches and eyestrain from running bright blue and white monitors late at night. Love it. Try it.
* [LINQPad](http://www.linqpad.net/) - Interactively query your databases with LINQ with this tool from Joseph Albahari. A fantastic learning tool for those who are just getting into LINQ or for those who want a code snippet IDE to execute any C# or VB expression. Free and wonderful. There's a whole list of LINQ related tools on Jim Wooley's (http://www.thinqlinq.com/Post.aspx/Title/LINQ-Tools) site as well.
* [scriptcs](http://scriptcs.net/) - You can easily install scriptcs with Chocolatey, and you'll quickly be able to execute C# scripts with no need to compile. Just make a .csx file, no need for even a class if you like, and you're off. It's C# and PowerShell and something more.
* [Fiddler](http://www.fiddlertool.com/) - The easy, clean, and powerful debugging proxy for checking out HTTP between here and there. It even supports sniffing SSL traffic.
* [BrowserStack](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/crossbrowserdebuggingintegratedintovisualstudiowithbrowserstack.aspx) - Browser Stack is an amazing cloud of virtual machines running dozens of browsers on as many operating system. A fantastic cross-browser testing tool that has optional Visual Studio integration.
* [HeidiSQL](http://www.heidisql.com/) - Complete tiny MySQL and SqlServer management app. Supported by apps.
* [ProcessExplorer](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653) - The ultimate replacement for TaskManager. Includes the amazing Find DLL feature to find out what processes have your DLL in memory.
