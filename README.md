# InfiniteToolCollection
Everyone collects or use online utilities, and most folks have a list of a few that they feel are indispensable.  Here's my ongoing list.  Each has a distinct purpose, and I probably touch each at least a few times a week/month/year.  For me, "util" means utilitarian and it means don't clutter my tray.  If it saves me time, and seamlessly integrates with my life, it's the bomb. Many/most are free some aren't. Those that aren't free are very likely worth your 30-day trial, and very likely worth your money.
